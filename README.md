### Hi, I'm Zuzaj 👋

- I'm a first-year Computer Science and Intelligent Systems student 😎
- My university is AGH UST :green_circle: ⚫ 🔴
- I’m looking for help with probably everything 🤷‍♀️
- I'm currently working on [IT Tools project](https://github.com/Zuzaj/Zuzaj.github.io)

Here is an [interesting article](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/learning-the-beauty-in-songs-neural-singing) about Neural Singing Voice Beautifier

And my [forked repository](https://github.com/Zuzaj/NeuralSVB.git)
 devoted to this topic
